# Meeting Intelligence System (COMP 482) — AMI Corpus

End to end system to extract action items from AMI meetings, map them to people and roles, add deadlines, and serve a Streamlit dashboard. 
Includes a rule-based baseline and an ML classifier trained via weak labels from the rules.

## Quick start
1. Python 3.10 or 3.11.
2. Create venv and install:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux
   # source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Generate a sample AMI-style transcript and roles:
   ```bash
   scripts/prepare_sample.bat
   ```
4. Run extraction and weakly-supervised ML training:
   ```bash
   scripts/run_extract.bat
   scripts/run_train_ml.bat
   ```
5. Launch the Streamlit UI:
   ```bash
   scripts/run_streamlit.bat
   ```

## What you get
- **Rule baseline**: interpretable regex patterns for “can you,” “please,” “need to,” “work on,” “I will,” “let’s.”
- **ML model**: TF–IDF + Logistic Regression classifier trained from weak labels produced by the rules, then used to refine action detection.
- **Temporal parsing**: relative dates to ISO using `dateparser`.
- **Outputs**: `data/processed/actions.json` containing `meeting`, `speaker`, `speaker_role`, `assignee`, `assignee_role`, `action_item`, `deadline_text`, `deadline_iso`.
- **Dashboard**: Streamlit filterable table.
- **Evaluation**: simple precision/recall/F1 against a tiny `gold.json` if you add it.
